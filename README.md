# tableau_dashboard
#For this project, we used the Yelp.csv data to create a dashboard using Tableau
#The project had two primary objectives:
# 1) Wrangle,  Transform,  and  Clean  the  Yelp!   data  from  its  current  JSON  format  to  a  CSVformat that can be easily analyzed.  Deliverable:  a final csv file with the data. 
# 2) Using the data that has been wrangled,  design out a dashboard that will display the fol-lowing  4  plots,  as  well  as  allow  the  user  to  interact  with  the  dashboard.   When  the  user clicks on any information on any of the plots, the data should be filtered using the clicked information
#. -  geographic map that displays state level data.  The data should be the average starrating in that state.  Please use the color-coded map (usually this is the second mapoption in Tableau). (Hint, make sure you use the level of detail expression to computethis average, since the unit of analysis here is business-attribute, and NOT business.
#. - A  bar  plot  that  displays  the  number  of  restaurants  that  have  each  attribute,  sortedfrom highest number to lowest number.  Each single bar should represent one singleattribute.
#. - A Tree Map showing the number of restaurants in each primary category for the top25 primary categories (hint, use a "top" filter, and make sure to use a "Distinct Count"calculated field to count the restaurants).
#. - histogram showing all the star ratings (bin size is to be determined by you, ensureto use the calculated field from the geographic map question).

# DELIVERABLE:
#Create your .twbx file.  The file should contain four worksheets, one for each visualization,and a dashboard that combines all of them together. Ensure that all appropriate actions arecreated so that the dashboard remains interactive.  Please do NOT submit a .zip, pictures,pdfs, or any other material.
